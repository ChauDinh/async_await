# Asynchronous 

* Asynchronous is when something is going on but we don't want to wait until the thing is done to continue our program, instead continue while the thing's happening. 

* Asynchronous is really relevant to JavaScript because we often make requests to server/API, which can taking a couple of seconds to get data back.
